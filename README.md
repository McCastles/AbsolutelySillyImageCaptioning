# AbsolutelySillyImageCaptioning

The projct is to be though of as a hobby and educational project rather than anything else. 


Generating captions for images using [Mask R-CNN](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN) and [Google Conceptual Captions (GCC)](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/conceptual-captions) dataset. 


The step-by-step explanation of the image captioning is in [`Usage.ipynb`](https://github.com/McCastles/AbsolutelySillyImageCaptioning/blob/master/src/Usage.ipynb).


The `AbsolutelySillyImageCaptioning` folder is to be placed under `samples` subfolder in the Mask R-CNN project structure. To lunch the system a `gcc_train.tsv` has to be put in the `data` folder.
